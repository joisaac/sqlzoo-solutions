# SQLZOO Solutions
These are the solutions I coded in SQL for all exercises on [SQL
ZOO](<https://napier.sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial>)
I was introduced to this from the course [The Complete SQL Bootcamp
2020](<https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/>) in Udemy by
Jose Portilla. All the knowledge you need to solve these execises is covered in
this course.
# Help
These are my first exercises in SQL, hence I required some help
I mostly use [this site](<https://sarapesavento.wordpress.com>) from Sara Pesavento [@spesavento](<https://spesavento>) when I had any doubt or required extra help.

*If you can imagine it, you can code it!*
