# SQLZOO Solutions
These are the solutions I coded in SQL for all exercises on [SQL
ZOO](<https://napier.sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial>)
I was introduced to this practice site from the course [The Complete SQL Bootcamp
2020](<https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/>) in Udemy by
Jose Portilla. All you need to solve these execises can be found in
this course.
# Help
These are my first exercises in SQL, hence, I required some extra help.
- I mostly use [this site](<https://sarapesavento.wordpress.com>) from Sara Pesavento [@spesavento](<https://github.com/spesavento>) when I had any doubt or required extra help.
- I also use the solution for the exercise no. 10 [Self
  JOIN](https://github.com/joisaac/sqlzoo-solutions/blob/main/Self-JOIN.sql)
from [@peterrobert](https://github.com/peterrobert) [SQLZOO
repository](https://github.com/peterrobert/SQL_ZOO).

If there is even a typing mistake or you want to contribute with ideas or
better solutions, do not hesitate.
